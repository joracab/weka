Additional Dependencies
-----------------------

Rattle depends on the GTK+ libraries being installed. You may also
like to install the ggobi application. These are external to R
itself. For each of the major operating systems refer to the
appropriate installation guides:

For MS/Windows, see

For Mac OS/X, see

R Dependencies
--------------

The rattle package is built on top of more than 40 other R packages,
all available from CRAN.

Instead of each of these other packages being a dependency (Depend:)
they are listed as suggested packages (Suggests:). This way, they will
not all be loaded when rattle is started. This can take some time.

Many of the packages are only required for specific
functionality. Rattle will check the availability of a package and
notify the user of its absence. You may then choose to install that
package.

Alternatively, when installing the rattle package, include the
Suggests dependencies:

> install.packages("rattle", dependencies=c("Depends", "Suggests"))
